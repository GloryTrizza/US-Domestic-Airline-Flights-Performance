# US Domestic Airline Flights Performance Dashboard Project
This project is focused on analyzing the performance of US domestic airlines using a dataset of flight records from 2019. The data was sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and contains flight information from 29 domestic airlines.

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that allows users to explore and visualize different aspects of airline performance, such as on-time arrival rates, flight cancellations, and delays. The dashboard was created using Python and the Dash framework, which is a web-based application framework for building interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory of this repository. It contains flight information from January 2019 to December 2019, including information on the airline, flight number, origin and destination airports, departure and arrival times, and various performance metrics.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of several interactive components that allow users to explore different aspects of airline performance. The main components are:

A dropdown menu that allows users to select the airline they want to analyze.
* A date picker that allows users to select a date range for the analysis.
* Three plots that display performance metrics for the selected airline and date range:
-    On-time arrival rate
-    Flight cancellations
-    Flight delays

Users can interact with these components to explore different aspects of airline performance and gain insights into which airlines perform well and which ones do not.

## Conclusion
This project provides a useful tool for analyzing the performance of US domestic airlines using a dataset of flight records from 2019. The dashboard allows users to explore different aspects of airline performance and gain insights into which airlines perform well and which ones do not. By using Python and the Dash framework, this project demonstrates how data can be transformed into an interactive and accessible format that can be easily explored and analyzed by a wide range of users.
